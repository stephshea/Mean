How does MEAN connect with MVC
Create a text file and write up how you feel the pieces in MEAN connect with the concept of MVC we will discuss tomorrow the connections.

The pieces in MEAN are using to carry out each MVC component, combining client-side and server-side operations to create powerful applications. 


M Model - database (Mongo)
V View - front-end (Angualr.js)
C Controller - backend (Express.js, Node.js)

NOTES
MVC way of organizing full stack. URL does not access database directly. User is not cut off but doesn't have direct access.

Model View Controller >>user>>browser(table)>>view(finished display)>>controller(cook)>>model(ingredients, database)

standard request -- user asks for file; browser displays file

only controller communicates with model but model data is filter and sent by controller -- data in databse that user can never access -- no direct access, only thru controller -- the moodel no front public access
